{"name":"Routr","body":"# Routr #\r\nRoutr is a simple routing library that enables you to listen to url patters you difine. This library was started as an experiment after been inspired by alot of popular libraries.\r\n\r\nRoutr is  powerful and flexible routing engine and if used properly it can reduce code complexity by decoupling objects and also by abstracting navigation paths and server requests.\r\n\r\n## USAGE ##\r\n\r\n- [API Documentation](#api)\r\n- [Example](#examples)\r\n\r\n\r\n### API Documentation ###\r\n\r\n- **change(callback)** [Event]\r\nEvent dispatched when there is a change in url hash\r\n- **addRoute(pattern,callback)** [Method]\r\nMethod allows us to add url pattern to the Route engine.\r\n\r\n### Examples 1 ####\r\n\r\nCallback function gets triggered everytime there is a change in the hash tag.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n  <!html>\r\n  <html>\r\n    <head>\r\n      <script src=\"/js/libs/routes.debug.js\"></script>\r\n      <script>\r\n\r\n        G.Routes.change(function(data){\r\n          document.getElementById('main').innerHTML += \"<br>\" + data + \" Selected\";\r\n        });\r\n      </script>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n    </body>\r\n  </html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Examples 2 ####\r\n\r\nYou can also declare a routes pattern with one or more parameters. Everytime there is a change in the url string a callback function is triggers and a object with url params is returned. \r\n\r\n```html\r\n  <!html>\r\n  <html>\r\n    <head>\r\n      <script src=\"/js/libs/routes.debug.js\"></script>\r\n      <script>\r\n\r\n        G.Routes.addRoute('/news/:title/:id/:slug',function(data){\r\n          document.getElementById('main').innerHTML += \"<br>News with id \" + data.id + \"and Title \" + data.title + \" selected\";\r\n        });\r\n\r\n\r\n        G.Routes.addRoute('/news/:id',function(data){ \r\n          document.getElementById('main').innerHTML += \"<br>News with id \" + data.id + \" selected\";\r\n        });\r\n      </script>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n    </body>\r\n  </html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Licence ##\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 [@CreativeAura](http://www.twitter.com/CreativeAura).\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
